Hello and welcome to the course website for PAI 721, "Introduction to Statistics." I am your instructor, [Professor Jack Reilly](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/jack-reilly).  You can find more about me on my [website](https://jacklreilly.github.io), but in short: 

- Statistics and data analysis is honestly one of my favorite things to teach. I've been teaching them for over 15 years now, at [multiple](https://www.ucdavis.edu) [different](https://www.ncf.edu) [institutions](https://www.syracuse.edu/), and I'm very much looking forward to doing so again this semester with you all.  

- I also research and write papers on [American politics and quantitative methods](https://jacklreilly.github.io/research), was born and raised right here in beautiful [Upstate New York](https://discoverupstateny.com), and while I love Syracuse and Central New York, I'd probably rather be hiking or canoeing in the [Adirondacks](https://visitadirondacks.com) right now.

Please take a minute to browse this website, where you'll find the course [syllabus](syllabus.qmd), topic [schedule](schedule.qmd), course [assignments](assignments/index.qmd), class and university academic [policies](policies.qmd), and [more](ai.qmd).

Finally, if you'd like this website and syllabus in an alternate format, please note you can download .pdfs or .docxs of any page on the site simply by clicking the link on the page.  You can also download a full copy of the main syllabus contents of the site (syllabus, schedule, and policies) as a course pack here:
