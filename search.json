    "text": "Description\nPublic policy and administration decisions are often difficult and risky because decisions must be made with incomplete and imperfect information. The primary purpose of this course is to introduce the basics of modeling and analyzing problems that involve decision-making under uncertainty. A high priority will be placed on learning how to choose the appropriate statistics to examine a particular problem, and how to avoid being misled by statistics presented by others that do not appropriately reflect available information."

Introduction to the Practice of Statistics. W.H. Freeman and Company. Any edition 6th or newer is sufficient.\nFor Public Admin: Meier, Kenneth, Jeffery Brudney, and John Bohte. Applied Statistics for Public and Nonprofit Administration. Cengage. Any recent edition is fine\nWeb Option: Favero, Nathan. Statistics Minus the Math: An Introduction for Social Sciences (https://minusthemath.com)\n\nYou may find one of these books suits you better than the other. (I recommend trying each!) Each book has a slightly different focus. Favero is more focused on a math-light presentation, preferring conceptual explanations, but is light in detail (especially in probability). Moore et al. is a more traditional statistics book (although still applied). Meier et al. is very clearly targeted at Public Administration, but the content itself jumps around a bit relative to the order our presentation of material. If you have strong opinions about any book at the end of the semester, let me know!\nRecommended: A resource to assist you with Stata usage and coding.\n\nTraditional: Acock, Alan. Stata: A Gentle Introduction. Stata Press. Any edition 4th or newer is sufficient.\nWeb Resources: UCLA Statistical Methods and Data Analytics Stata Learning Modules: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/modules/"

Otherwise, a 6-month subscription is also available ($48). For those of you who do not wish to purchase your own version, copies are located on the computers in the student clusters in the basement of Eggers.

    "section": "Attendance",
    "text": "Attendance\nOne of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own time. I have little interest in policing your lives. Attendance is kept for each day of class, but you will lose no points on attendance if you miss a couple days: everyone has things that occasionally come up in life that need to be dealt with, and I fully realize that some of those things are things you — very understandably — may not want to discuss with your professor. That’s OK!\nThat said, attendance in class is an important element to doing well in the course. If you miss more than a couple days, it’s advisable to check in. (That way, I also won’t mark your attendance grade off for chronic absenteeism.) The easiest way to do this is just email me with a brief reason when something comes up and you have to miss class (which will also allow me to tell you if you’re missing anything particularly important).\nIf you must miss class, the way to make up what you’ve missed is straightforward: make sure to look over the posted slides, do the reading for the day, get notes from a friend, and still complete the assignment if you are able (or, if it is a day we are going over the assignment, make sure to look over the assignment solutions). If you do these things and still feel like you’re missing something, please feel free to come into my office hours and we can talk it through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteParticipation\n\n\n\nThere is no formal grade for “participation”. However, I reserve the right to dock a couple points here if you do ridiculous/unprofessional things in class (like answering your cell phone, always coming in late and regularly distracting others, spontaneously breaking out into ribald song in the middle of class, etc)."

    "text": "Weekly Assignments\nThere is an assignment each week in class, due Friday at midnight.2 Assignments will vary in nature: some will be one-off problem sets, some may build on problem sets from a prior week. All material needed for an assignment will be covered by the Tuesday before the assignment is due, and the assignment itself will be posted no later than Tuesday of the week in question. There is no penalty for turning in an assignment up until the Tuesday of the following week. However, no assignment work is accepted after class Tuesday of the following week, as we will go over answers for assignments together in class. There will typically be no assignments on weeks when other significant work (practicums, tests) are due, and students may miss up to two assignments without penalty. Students may also work together on assignments, although each student is ultimately responsible for their own work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAssignment Evaluation\n\n\n\nAssignments are evaluated based upon effort and a check completion system. Students who answer every problem will earn a check, with each check worth one point toward their final assignment grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningComputing\n\n\n\nMost homework assignments will be done on a computer using Stata. Do not simply hand in output from Stata. Instead, paste the relevant results into a word processor adding text to explain these results. You must also hand in reproducible script (.do) files with your analysis. (Don’t worry, we’ll cover what this means.)"

I suggest you work on assignments starting on Tuesday of the week in question and finish them early enough so your Friday afternoon and evening isn’t overcome with them.↩︎\nWhile regular weekly assignments are check/no-check credit, on practicums, you’ll receive a certain number of points out of the total.↩︎\nAgain: usually I’m much faster!

    "text": "The following reflects the approved campus-wide academic policies of Syracuse University. For more information and detail, please consult the full documentation of University policies here.\n\n\nAs part of our efforts to track satisfactory academic progress, the Academic Drop Deadline and the Financial Drop deadline will both occur on September 15, 2025, for the fall semester and February 2, 2026, for the spring semester. Students may still withdraw from courses after these deadlines; this would place a ‘WD’ grade on their transcripts. Students enrolled in “flex” classes (Flexibly formatted classes) have different deadlines and will need to check MySlice for the Academic and Financial Drop deadlines that pertains to their class.\n\n\n\nAs a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n\n\n\nBased on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following: all weekly assignments. Artificial intelligence is not permitted in tests and practicums. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for more information about what artificial intelligence tools are permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited except when documented permission is granted.\nPlease also see Syracuse University’s general campus AI policies here.\n\n\n\nAll academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.\nUsing websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation, resulting in suspension or expulsion from Syracuse University.\n\n\n\nAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. It is a federal requirement that faculty promptly notify the university of students who do not attend or cease to attend any class. Faculty will use Early-Semester Progress Reports and Mid-Semester Progress Reports in Orange SUccess to alert the Registrar and Financial Aid Office on non-attendance. For more information visit:\nFaculty: Information for Faculty: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending Students: Information for Students: Non-attendance or Stopped Attending\nIf a student is unable to participate in-person or virtually for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), the student may request an absence notification from their home school/college Dean’s Office or through Student Outreach and Support office. Instructors will be notified via the “Absence Notification” flag in Orange SUccess.\nBarnes Center at the Arch (Health, Counseling, etc.) staff will not provide medical excuse notes for students. When Barnes Center staff determine it is medically necessary to remove a student from classes, they will coordinate with Student Outreach and Support case management staff to provide appropriate notification to faculty through Orange Success. For absences lasting less than 48 hours, students are encouraged to discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.\nAdditional information may be found at Student Outreach and Support: Absence Notifications.\n\n\n\nThis class will use the Blackboard Learning Management to house the syllabus, course content, links to external course materials, assignments, quizzes, exams, feedback, and grades. Due dates and times in Blackboard are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and displayed for each user based on the time zone setting of their computer and data from their internet browser. The system will always display the time zone being used. If an instructor sets a due date of 11pm Eastern time, a student in the Pacific time zone will see a due date of 8pm.”\nInformation about Blackboard is available on Answers Blackboard; alternatively, you can contact Information Technology Services by sending an email to help@syr.edu, calling 315.443.2677, or in-person at the ITS Service Center, located at 1-227 CST in the Life Sciences Complex. Business hours for the Service Center can be found on the ITS website.\n\n\n\nThe University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions, disability, marital status, political or social affiliation, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender.\nAny complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer for Faculty and Staff.

    "section": "AI and Learning",
    "text": "AI and Learning\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the smartphone, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilites are only growing.1 There are also lots of concerns about AI’s destructive potential, especially for higher education.2\nI do not think AI is the end of higher eduation. However, I do think that, for you as a student to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is and how to use it in a way that is both (1) effective and (2) does not hamstring your learning. Current AI models are what is known as Large Language Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – which you can think of as a word – that is most likely to make sense in a sentence or phrase, based upon the input prompt and some surrounding context. It is not an “intelligence” like a human is, and it does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will be incidentally true and/or functional. That is what makes it useful! Occasionally, it will also produce nonsense (or what we know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks, hold cheese on pizza with glue, failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals, and made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Humorous Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a philosophical sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and somewhat profanity-averse professor feel gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a course syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what philosophy so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the English language, why limit ourselves to using the banal sounding “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code, conduct data analysis, and interpret it, the problem is often that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFurthermore, using LLMs early on in your learning can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics.6 Many of your assignments for this class, for instance, are intentionally created to give you practice on beginning concepts - concepts that ChatGPT can answer in a trivially easy fashion. Practice is what gives you familiarity and comfort and working knowledge, but practice doesn’t happen if you just copy language or code that an AI gives you.\nEven more problematically, it is these beginning concepts which, when will understood, will eventually enable your most effecive use of this new class of tools for statistical and data work! Accordingly, if you elect to use generative AI to help you with assignments, I strongly encourage you to use them intelligently, rather than carelessly. Use them to help you learn, not to replace your learning; think of them like an interlocuter or teaching assistant, not like an answer bot. Even if plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely put you at a long-term disadvantage, even when using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantResponsible AI\n\n\n\nRemember: whenever you use AI tools for a project you attach your name to, you are still taking implicit responsiblity for that project, product, or document. This means that it is incumbent upon you to do the followup work necessary to validate, verify, and confirm that the language and work produced by the machine that works without regard for truth actually is accurate and functional. AI is not a coauthor,8 and I promise you that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, etc won’t take responsibility for whatever you produce with their tools - that’s on you.9\nJust like any other tool or source you use, all use of AI, in anything you turn in for this class, should be documented and identified in your work. If you used AI to help you write code, note you used AI to help you write code. If you use it to help you write analysis, note how you used it to help you write analysis."

    "text": "Suggestions and Guidelines: AI usage in our course\nFor the reasons above, I would strongly encourage you to be skeptical and not overuse AI as you learn. My job, goal, and interest in this class is to help you, my human student, learn how to do valuable things like write code; wrangle and visualize data; critically interpret information; and learn how to be a more effective citizen and human engaging in the study of data analysis, management, and policy. My interest is not in correcting AI slop,10 nor does my interest lie in trying to figure out if you are attempting to pass unadulterated AI slop11 off as your own work.12 After all, you are allowed to use AI on assignments, if you wish, and I encourage you to do so in productive and valuable ways to enhance your learning, rather than as a way to cheat. Your education, as always, is only as valuable as what you put into it.\nWith all of that said, poor uses of AI are often easily detectable to the eye of me, your professor, and get bad grades regardless.13 Some examples:\n\nStudents who turn in papers and problem sets that reference methodological tools or techniques way beyond the understanding of the material they show in person or on in-class tests and assignments. (I’ve seen many students propose using methods that would only come to them in their third or fourth semester of statistics in an introductory research methods class, for instance.)\nStudents who successfully complete coding assignments, but do so in ways that are overly verbose and complicated relative to simpler and more straightforward methods and techniques covered in class.\nStudents who authoritatively reference scholars who don’t exist, or authoritatively reference scholars that exist but articles or books that those scholars never wrote.\nStudents who turn in assignments that match the style of documents that are well represented in the training set of an LLM (like a five paragraph essay, for instance) but do so for an assignment where the directions were clearly for something else (like, say, a Socratic dialogue.)\n\nIf you do such things in your work, you will find that I take points off not necessarily because you used AI, but because you’ve made a poor use of AI, and the work doesn’t meet the standards of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI would also encourage you to not make the mistake of confusing assessement with learning.14 Assessment is an obligation of your professor to measure how well you know class material, but assessment is not the end goal of education any more than taking your blood pressure is the end goal of going to a physician’s office. The goal of an education is for you to learn and enhance your critical thinking in ways that will enrich your personal and professional lives. Don’t mistake the means for the end: I don’t care about assessing what ChatGPT “thinks” about something any more than your physician cares about measuring what ChatGPT’s blood pressure is, and I would suggest that you probably don’t care much about that, either.\nUse AI like a tool, keep your thinking your own, and remember: your education is about your own enrichment, not about passing some tests and assignments."

There are also a broader set of other AI-related things happening at Syracuse, including events through the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute (ASPI), resources organized by ITS, and many more.\nA few other things I’d recommend:\n\nMelanie Mitchell, professor at the Santa Fe Institute and one of the most nuanced thinkers about AI I know, has a series of articles that are well worth reading as well as an excellent podcast she hosted on AI. She was also interviewed for the excellently titled “How Your Cheese-Powered Baby Trounces AI”.\nAndrew Heiss, a professor in public management and policy at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School, has a digression on AI and education that’s worth looking through, including the sources and footnotes.\nGary Marcus’ substack is generally critical of current AI technology, but a good place to keep up on current AI trends and hype. Luiza Jarovsky’s substack is a good place to read about AI governance.\nIf you’re more interested in the business and tech industry sides of AI, Benjamin Evans and Ben Thompson are worth adding to your bookmarks/RSS reader/email inbox/future mechanism for keeping track of internet news that hasn’t yet been invented.\n\nFinally, as I’m always eager to know how far students actually read syllabi: if you have reached this point, and are still reading about AI and my thoughts on it, send me an email with a recommendation for your favorite artificial intelligence related novel, movie, or TV-show. I’ll give you a bonus point on your next test."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nI for instance, used AI tools to help me build this course website, and I would guess that I was able to do it about twice as quickly as I would have been able to without AI.↩︎\nFor just a small sampling, see here, here, here, and here.↩︎\nGenerally speaking, at least. If you’re paying attention to some of the details with AI, you know about something called an LRM - or Large Reasoning Model. To a first approximation, they try to introduce better and more complex reasoning into the base prediction process, sometimes going so far to do things like generate python code to do math analysis. These “reasoning” models, however, still often fall short on relatively simple reasoning tasks (see Apple, 2025, The Illusion of Thinking).↩︎\nFrankfurt, 2005, On Bullshit; Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024, ChatGPT is Bullshit. For those interested in a full taxonomy, Frankfurt helpfully helps us distinguish between bullshit and any number of additional different not-quite-truthisms, including humbug, hot air, bluff, bravado, and lying.↩︎\nFor another excellent example of profanity being used to elegantly make forceful points in academic settings, see Healy, 2017, “Fuck Nuance”, which genuinely contains very good advice on writing. (Although to be fair, you can also get most of the point of that article just from the title . . . which is also the point.)↩︎\nSee, for instance, Lehmann, Cornelius, and Sting, 2024↩︎\nThere’s no school like the old school. Insert proper “value of doing the tough work” metaphor here: eating your vegetables, walking uphill both ways to school in a snowstorm, learning to program in assembly before C, etc.↩︎\nMany publications, for instance, have explict and clear instructions that prevent you from cheekily listing ChatGPT or Claude as a coauthor, in fact - even if they allow for the use of ChatGPT in the production of the manuscript. See, for instance, this discussion in regards to journals published by Springer-Nature.↩︎\nA good parallel here is Microsoft Office: if you write some nonsensible hot garbage in Word, Microsoft is never going to take responsiblity for any of that business. They’ll (correctly) note that it was just some dumb human that wrote it using their tool.↩︎\nAn arduous, unending, and unenviable task, like Sisyphus with his rock.↩︎\nAI slop: also known as, well, you know.↩︎\nAccordingly, I will generally not spend time trying to guess if your assignments are improperly AI generated, nor will I typically engage with technology that purports to do this for me. The technical tools that try to detect LLM writing are imperfect, anyways, resulting in a lot of uncertainty and false positives.↩︎\nGood, and effective, AI usage often has the property of being largely undetectable, even to a trained eye – that’s often part of what makes it effective use of the tool, actually!↩︎\nAn all too common mistake made today by many people, for the record. Much of the pearl-clutching around AI in education is really focused on how we can know know or detect whether or not students are “cheating” on test and assignments, and less about how we can actually integrate AI meaningfully into the learning process.↩︎"

The primary purpose of this course is to introduce the basics of modeling and analyzing problems that involve decision-making under uncertainty. A high priority will be placed on learning how to choose the appropriate statistics to examine a particular problem, and how to avoid being misled by statistics presented by others that do not appropriately reflect available information."

    "text": "Attendance\nOne of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own time. I have little interest in policing your lives. Attendance is kept for each day of class, but you will lose no points on attendance if you miss a couple days: everyone has things that occasionally come up in life that need to be dealt with, and I fully realize that some of those things are things you — very understandably — may not want to discuss with your professor. That’s OK!\nThat said, attendance in class is an important element to doing well in the course. If you miss more than a couple days, it’s advisable to check in. (That way, I also won’t mark your attendance grade off for chronic absenteeism.) The easiest way to do this is just email me with a brief reason when something comes up and you have to miss class (which will also allow me to tell you if you’re missing anything particularly important).\nIf you must miss class, the way to make up what you’ve missed is straightforward: make sure to look over the posted slides, do the reading for the day, get notes from a friend, and still complete the assignment if you are able (or, if it is a day we are going over the assignment, make sure to look over the assignment solutions). If you do these things and still feel like you’re missing something, please feel free to come into my office hours and we can talk it through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteParticipation\n\n\n\nThere is no formal grade for “participation”. However, I reserve the right to dock a couple points here if you do ridiculous/unprofessional things in class (like answering your cell phone, always coming in late and regularly distracting others, spontaneously breaking out into ribald song in the middle of class, etc)."

All material needed for an assignment will be covered by the Tuesday before the assignment is due, and the assignment itself will be posted no later than Tuesday of the week in question. There is no penalty for turning in an assignment up until the Tuesday of the following week. However, no assignment work is accepted after class Tuesday of the following week, as we will go over answers for assignments together in class. There will typically be no assignments on weeks when other significant work (practicums, tests) are due, and students may miss up to two assignments without penalty. Students may also work together on assignments, although each student is ultimately responsible for their own work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAssignment Evaluation\n\n\n\nAssignments are evaluated based upon effort and a check completion system. Students who answer every problem will earn a check, with each check worth one point toward their final assignment grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningComputing\n\n\n\nMost homework assignments will be done on a computer using Stata.

Under the policy, students are given an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance, provided they notify their instructors no later than the academic drop deadline. For observances occurring before the drop deadline, notification is required at least two academic days in advance. Students may enter their observances in MySlice under Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification."

I’ll also be around after office hours until at least 12:30 each Tuesday and Thursday according to student need. I also am usually around between 3:30 and 4 Tuesdays and Thursdays and free to meet, but give me a heads up if you plan on coming around at that time so I know to be on the lookout for you - I’m sometimes in another room with another class.↩︎\nAlthough, I should note, I very much hope you aren’t working on my assignments on Friday at 11 PM! I suggest you work on assignments starting on Tuesday of the week in question and finish them early enough so your Friday afternoon and evening isn’t overcome with them.↩︎\nWhile regular weekly assignments are check/no-check credit, on practicums, you’ll receive a certain number of points out of the total.↩︎\nAgain: usually I’m much faster! But if you don’t hear from me by this baseline, feel free to bump a reminder.↩︎"
