The primary purpose of this course is to introduce the basics of modeling and analyzing problems that involve decision-making under uncertainty. A high priority will be placed on learning how to choose the appropriate statistics to examine a particular problem, and how to avoid being misled by statistics presented by others that do not appropriately reflect available information.\n\n# Objectives\n\nStudents will learn how to use quantitative data and statistical tools to understand problems, how to become smart consumers of statistical reports and quantitative information, and how to communicate statistical findings to a variety of audiences.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nThorough understanding of high school algebra and geometry.\n\n# Materials\n\n## Books\n\n**Required:** You will need a core statistics textbook for the class, and there are two options:\n\n- *Traditional*: Moore, David S., George P. McCabe, Bruce A. Craig. *Introduction to the Practice of Statistics*. W.H. Freeman and Company. *Any edition 6th or newer is sufficient.*\n- *Web Option*: Favero, Nathan. 2024. *Statistics Minus the Math: An Introduction for Social Sciences*. Free/open web resource: <https://minusthemath.com>\n\nYou may find one of these books suits you better than the other. *(I recommend trying both!)* Each book has a slightly different focus. Favero is more focused on a math-light presentation, preferring conceptual explanations, but is light in detail (especially in probability). Moore et al. is a more traditional statistics book (although still applied). If you have strong opinions about either book at the end of the semester, let me know!\n\n**Recommended:** A resource to assist you with Stata usage and coding.\n\n- *Traditional*: Acock, Alan. *Stata: A Gentle Introduction*. Stata Press. Any edition 4th or newer is sufficient.\n- *Web Resources*: UCLA Statistical Methods and Data Analytics Stata Learning Modules: <https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/modules/>\n\n## Software\n\nStata (any version after 13; the most basic is fine). You can also purchase a student license, which is available for 6- or 12-month intervals, or perpetually. See the Stata website for pricing: <https://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/profplus/student-pricing/>. If you will be taking PAI 722 in the Spring, I recommend a 12-month license ($94). Otherwise, a 6-month subscription is also available ($48). For those of you who do not wish to purchase your own version, copies are located on the computers in the student clusters in the basement of Eggers. You can also access Stata via Syracuse’s remote desktop: <http://rds.syr.edu>. Information on how to log in to the remote desktop is available **[here](https://su-jsm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ITHELP/pages/159941534/Remote+Desktop+Services+RDS)**.\n\n## Hardware\n\nThe department will provide a simple scientific calculator on exams for you to use, if you desire. Graphing calculators are not allowed in exams.\n\nYou will need to use a computer to complete assignments in this class. If you do not have one of your own, you may use one on campus. The student clusters in the basement of Eggers are likely the most convenient.\n\n## Online Class Resources\n\nThis website hosts the official course syllabus as well as course assignments, problems, and readings. In addition, [Blackboard](http://blackboard.syr.edu) is Syracuse University's course platform. In it, you will find occaisional course announcements, a submission portal for your assignments, and additional materials. In addition, during the semester, solutions to the problem sets and lecture slides will be posted. \n\nPlease note, however, that this is primarily an in-person, not online, class, and as such, class is the primary source of course-related announcements and material.\n\n# Course Requirements\n\n## Overview\n\nSatisfactory completion of the course requires completion of the following:\n\n1. Regular course preparation and attendance (10%)\n2. Assignments (20%)\n3. Midterm (35%)\n4. Final (35%)\n\n## Attendance\n\nOne of the guiding principles of my class is that you are adults, and thus, capable of managing your own time. I have little interest in policing your lives. Attendance is kept for each day of class, but you will lose no points on attendance if you miss a couple days: everyone has things that occasionally come up in life that need to be dealt with, and I fully realize that some of those things are things you—very understandably—may not want to discuss with your professor. That's OK!\n\nThat said, attendance in class is an important element to doing well in the course. If you miss more than a couple days, it's advisable to check in. (That way, I won't mark your attendance grade off for chronic absenteeism.) The easiest way to do this is just email me with a brief reason when something comes up and you have to miss class (which will also allow me to tell you if you're missing anything particularly important).\n\nIf you must miss class, the way to make up what you've missed is straightforward: make sure to look over the posted slides, do the reading for the day, get notes from a friend, and still complete the assignment if you are able (or, if it is a day we are going over the assignment, make sure to look over the assignment solutions). If you do these things and still feel like you're missing something, please feel free to come into my office hours and we can talk it through.\n\n## Participation\n\nClass participation will be based on your active participation in class and submitting “statistics in the wild” examples on Blackboard. On the course Blackboard page, there is a discussion board specifically for statistics in the wild. Please post links along with a brief (1–2 paragraphs) discussion of an example of bad statistics (bad graphics, examples of articles that conflate correlation and causation, etc.) or a good example of graphics or stories with some relation to topics we’ve discussed in class. Post at least one example with its corresponding discussion at some point during the semester.\n\n## Assignments\n\nThere is an assignment each week in class, **due Friday at midnight**.[^friday] Assignments will vary in nature: some will be one-off problem sets, some may build on problem sets from a prior week. All material needed for an assignment will be covered by the Tuesday before the assignment is due, and the assignment itself will be posted no later than Tuesday of the week in question. There is **no penalty** for turning in an assignment up until the Tuesday of the following week.  However, **no assignment work is accepted after class Tuesday of the following week**, as we will go over answers for assignments in class.\n\nAssignments are evaluated on a check completion system. Students who answer every problem will earn a check, with each check worth one point toward their assignment grade.[^rare]\n\nThere will be no assignments on the midterm week. Students may miss up to two assignments without penalty. \n\n## Computing\n\nMost homework assignments will be done on a computer using Stata. Do not simply hand in output from Stata. Instead, paste the relevant results into a word processor adding text to explain these results.\n\n## Tests\n\nTests may have in-class and out-of-class components. The course is cumulative, and each test will be comprehensive.\n\n# Course Expectations & Guidelines\n\n## Etiquette & Decorum\n\nA college course is fundamentally a learning community. Be courteous to fellow students and the professor. Don't let yourself be distracted by your cell phone in class, and don't let what is on your computer screen distract fellow students in the class, either.\n\n## Office & Consultation Hours, Appointments\n\nI encourage you to chat with me at any point if you have questions about the course. You can schedule a meeting with me by going to my website here: <http://jacklreilly.github.io/> and sign up for time at your convenience. You can also always just drop in during my regularly scheduled drop-in office hours without appointment. Your TA also has time dedicated to meeting with students outside of class (times noted in the syllabus header.)\n\n## E-mail\n\nEmail is the best way to contact me. Students can generally expect a response to all e-mails within 24 hours (and typically sooner), excepting weekends. If your email requires a long response, expect me to encourage you to schedule an appointment with me so that we can more effectively discuss the matter. Note that I do not typically respond to email over the weekend, so if you email me at 4 PM on Friday, you will likely not hear back from me until Monday.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence, LLMs, etc.\n\nArtificial Intelligence— in particular, Large Language Models like ChatGPT—are incredibly useful tools. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code and conduct statistics, using them can hamper your ability to understand fundamentals. Accordingly, all generative-AI tools are prohibited in this course because their use inhibits achievement of the course learning objectives. This policy applies to all stages of project and writing processes including researching, brainstorming, outlining, organizing, and polishing. Do not use Generative-AI tools to create any content (i.e., images and video, audio, text, code, etc.). If you have any questions about a feature and whether it is considered Generative-AI, ask your instructor.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis course, and this syllabus, consists in large parts of material developed by other professors in the PAI 721 rotation, including, but not limited to, Jun Li, Tomas Olivier, and Ying Shi. I am grateful for their support and permission to use their materials.\n\n[^friday]: Although, I should note, I very much hope you aren't working on my assignments on Friday at 11 PM! I suggest you work on assignments starting on Tuesday of the week in question and finish them early enough so your Friday afternoon and evening isn't overcome with them.\n[^rare]: In rare cases, partial credit (a half point) may be given for partially completed assignments.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\nMake meeting schedules for 1-4 Friday afternoons?\n\n# Course Information <i class=\"bi bi-mortarboard\" style=\"color:#333\"></i>\n\n::: callout-note\n### Key Info\n**Instructor**  \n**Prof. Jack Reilly**\n\n<i class=\"bi bi-geo-alt\"></i> Eggers 225F  \n<i class=\"bi bi-clock\"></i> Office Hours: **TBD**  \n<i class=\"bi bi-telephone\"></i> 315-443-2687  \n<i class=\"bi bi-envelope\"></i> <a href=\"mailto:jlreilly@syr.edu\">jlreilly@syr.edu</a>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top:0.5rem;\">\n  <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"mailto:jlreilly@syr.edu\">\n    <i class=\"bi bi-envelope-fill\"></i> Email Professor\n  </a>\n  <a class=\"btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm\" href=\"http://jacklreilly.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <i class=\"bi bi-calendar2-week\"></i> Schedule a Meeting\n  </a>\n</div>\n:::\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n### Contact & Location\n- <i class=\"bi bi-building\"></i> **Office:** Eggers 225F  \n- <i class=\"bi bi-telephone\"></i> **Phone:** 315-443-2687  \n- <i class=\"bi bi-envelope\"></i> **E-mail:** <a href=\"mailto:jlreilly@syr.edu\">jlreilly@syr.edu</a>\n\n::: callout-tip\n<i class=\"bi bi-lightbulb\"></i> **Best way to reach me:** Email.
